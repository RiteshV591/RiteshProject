#What is DOM Actually?

-> DOM stands for Document Object Model(Basically a structured representation of HTML Documents)

-> it allows JS to access HTML elements and Manipulate them.

(We can say it's a Connection point b/w HTML code and JS document)

-> HTML is stored in a DOM tree structure.

-------------------------------------------

=> Dom always Start with "DOCUMENT" Obejct (Serves as entry point of DOM)
Eg. document.querySelector();


-> 1st child element of Document is <html> elememt because it's root element in all html documents.

-> Two sibling element of <html> are <head> and <body>. There are more and more child elements of both head and body 

-> DOM tree has more than just element nodes. it also has nodes for all the texts, comments and all the other stuff.


"Whatever is in HTML document also has to be in DOM"

==============================================

DOM !== JAVASCRIPT

=> JavaScript and DOM are not simillar

-> JavaScript is a dialact in EcmaSript

-> DOM and DOM methods are actully a part of WEB APIs(Application Programming interface) These are libraries that browser implements and we can access those libraries from our JS Code

========================


To Use DOM:-

-> when we want to select an element from the html by it's class name

document.querySelector('.className');

OR

document.getElementByClassName("className");

-> if we wanted to select by ID name 

document.querySelector('#IdName');

OR

document.getElementById("IdName");

-> When we want to set a value to an input textbox


=========== Event Listner ===============

-> an event is something that happens on the page. For example, a mouse click, mouse moving, key press or many other events.

-> with an event listener, we can wait for a certain event to happen, and then react to it.
